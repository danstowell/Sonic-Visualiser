     * If mode is ReadOnly, the file must exist and be readable.
     *
     * If mode is WriteOnly, the file must not exist.
     *
     * cellSize specifies the size in bytes of the object type stored
     * in the matrix.  For example, use cellSize = sizeof(float) for a
     * matrix of floats.  The MatrixFile object doesn't care about the
     * objects themselves, it just deals with raw data of a given size.
     *
     * width and height specify the dimensions of the file.  These
     * cannot be changed after construction.
     *
     * MatrixFiles are reference counted by name.  When the last
     * MatrixFile with a given name is destroyed, the file is removed.
     * These are temporary files; the normal usage is to have one
     * MatrixFile of WriteOnly type creating the file and then
     * persisting until all readers are complete.
     *
     * MatrixFile has no built-in cache and is not thread-safe.  Use a
     * separate MatrixFile in each thread.
